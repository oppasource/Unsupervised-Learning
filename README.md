# Unsupervised-Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms are the one where the machine learns from the data that dosen't really have any target values.

One of the ways of unsupervised learning is clustering. This involves forming clusters of the given data with respect to some structure in it. One of the most popular clustering algorithms is k-means algorithm which has been demonstrated in this repo.
