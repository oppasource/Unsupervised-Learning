# Unsupervised-Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms are the one where the machine learns from the data that dosen't really have any target values. Which implies that the data is unlabeled.

One of the approaches to unsupervised learning is clustering. This involves forming clusters of the given data with respect to some structure in it. Which imples grouping of data which is more similar into one group. One of the most popular clustering algorithms is k-means algorithm which has been demonstrated in this repo.
